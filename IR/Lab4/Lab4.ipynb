The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.\n",

    "IDF (inverse document frequency) - is a measure of how much information the word provides. If a word appears in every document it does not provide much information, but if it just appears in two documents then its impact on similiarity between these two documents is higher. The standard approach to compute this value is logarithm of number of documents divided by number of documents containing a given term $IDF(t) = log(\\frac{N}{n_t})$\n",
